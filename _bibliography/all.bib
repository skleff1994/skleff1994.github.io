  abstract  = {The promise of model-predictive control (MPC) in robotics has led to extensive development of efficient numerical optimal control solvers in line with differential dynamic programming because it exploits the sparsity induced by time. In this work, we argue that this effervescence has hidden the fact that sparsity can be equally exploited by standard nonlinear optimization. In particular, we show how a tailored implementation of sequential quadratic programming (QP) achieves state-of-the-art MPC. Then, we clarify the connections between popular algorithms from the robotics community and well-established optimization techniques. Further, the sequential quadratic program formulation naturally encompasses the constrained case, a notoriously difficult problem in the robotics community. Specifically, we show that it only requires a sparsity-exploiting implementation of a state-of-the-art QP solver. We illustrate the validity of this approach in a comparative study and experiments on a torque-controlled manipulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of closed loop nonlinear MPC with constraints on a real robot.}

  abstract     = {In robotics, traditional force control lacks local contact information. Tactile sensors provide rich feedback on physical interaction, but remain notably difficult to integrate into real-time control loops. This paper proposes a unified tactile servoing formulation that allows explicit control of contact pose and force at the Center of Pressure (CoP). Unlike conventional tactile servoing techniques, which are tightly coupled to a specific sensor and often treat the contact wrench as disturbance to be rejected, our approach relies on a generic and physically grounded feature space. We derive a hybrid force-position control law based on the Jacobian at the CoP that naturally decouples force and motion subspaces, ensuring geometric consistency during the contact interaction. Our framework, validated on a robotic manipulator with visionbased tactile sensing, demonstrates robust contact maintenance and force tracking capabilities, outperforming standard imagebased and pose-based controllers in tasks requiring precise regulation of the physical interaction.}

But its performance remains fundamentally limited in tasks involving contact with the environment, in part because optimal control policies do not reason over force measurements. In this article, we propose a first complete answer to this issue by introducing a novel approach to perform force feedback in model-predictive control. We propose to augment the state-space with a visco-elastic model of the contact force in the task space in order to systematically include measured efforts into the optimal control loop. We derive a complete predictive controller with an efficient formulation whose implementation is released in open-source. We demonstrate through simulation studies and hardware experiments that our approach enables to combine the benefits of force control and model-predictive control within a single architecture, thereby outperforming existing approaches in challenging contact tasks.}

However, the real-time requirement has limited the use of hard constraints and large preview horizons, which are necessary to ensure safety and stability. In practice, practitioners have to carefully design cost functions that can imitate an infinite horizon formulation, which is tedious and often results in local minima. In this work, we study how to approximate the infinite horizon value function of constrained optimal control problems with neural networks using value iteration and trajectory optimization. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate how using this value function approximation as a terminal cost provides global stability to the model predictive controller. The approach is validated on two toy problems and a real-world scenario with online obstacle avoidance on an industrial manipulator where the value function is conditioned to the goal and obstacle.}

We leverage recent results on Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability and differential games in order to compute offline guaranteed motion plans that are compatible with the sampled-data (SD) paradigm. Also, we synthesize online provably robust safety-preserving and target-reaching feedback controls. Unlike earlier applications of reachability analysis to MP, our methodology handles arbitrary time-varying constraints, adversarial agents such as pursuing obstacles or evading targets, and takes into account the robot’s configuration. Furthermore, we use HJ projections in order to reduce significantly the computational burden without trading off safety guarantees. The validity of this approach is demonstrated through the case study of a robot arm subject to measurement errors, which is tasked with safely reaching a goal in a known time-varying workspace while avoiding capture by an unpredictable pursuer. Finally, the performance of the approach and research perspectives are discussed.}

However it remains limited in contact interaction tasks due to its inability to leverage sensed efforts. In this work, we propose a novel model-predictive control approach that incorporates direct feedback from force sensors while circumventing explicit modeling of the contact force evolution. Our approach is based on the online estimation of the discrepancy between the force predicted by the dynamics model and force measurements, combined with high-frequency nonlinear model-predictive control. We report an experimental validation on a torque-controlled manipulator in challenging tasks for which accurate force tracking is necessary. We show that a simple reformulation of the optimal control problem combined with standard estimation tools enables to achieve state-of-the-art performance in force control while preserving the benefits of model-predictive control, thereby outperforming traditional force control techniques. This work paves the way toward a more systematic integration of force sensors in model predictive control.}

In particular, current progress in multi body dynamic simulators are under-pinning the implementation of reinforcement learning for end-to-end control of robotic systems. Yet simulators are mostly considered as black boxes while we have the knowledge to make them produce a richer information. In this paper, we are proposing to use the derivatives of the simulator to help with the convergence of the learning. For that, we combine model-based trajectory optimization to produce informative trials using 1st- and 2nd-order simulation derivatives. These locally-optimal runs give fair estimates of the value function and its derivatives, that we use to accelerate the convergence of the critics using Sobolev learning. We empirically demonstrate that the algorithm leads to a faster and more accurate estimation of the value function. The resulting value estimate is used in model-predictive controller as a proxy for shortening the preview horizon. We believe that it is also a first step toward superlinear reinforcement learning algorithm using simulation derivatives, that we need for end-to-end legged locomotion.},

  abstract  = {Contact dynamics relies on the simultaneous satisfaction of constraints at the robot body level and at the contact level. At both levels, various formulations can be chosen that all must lead to the same results, given the same hypothesis, hence the little importance of their details. Yet when using it in an optimal control problem, a particular formulation is often imposed by the task to be performed by the robot. In this paper, we detail the formulation of the contact quantities (force, movement) in an arbitrary frame imposed by the task. In that case, we will show that we are typically not interested in working in the local frame (attached to the robot contact point), nor in the world frame, but in a user-defined frame centered at the contact location with a fixed orientation in the world. The derivations can then be used for 6D, 3D or normal (pure-sliding) contact. We implemented the corresponding derivatives on top of the contact dynamics of the rigid-body dynamics library Pinocchio in the optimal control solver Crocoddyl. We show that a unique formulation is able to handle several operational orientations, by achieving several surfacing tasks in model predictive control with the robot Talos.}

Our controller leverages a state-of-the art optimal control solver, namely Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), in order to replan state and control trajectories at real-time rates (1kHz). In addition to this experimental proof of concept, an exhaustive performance analysis shows that our controller outperforms open-loop MPC on a rapid cyclic end-effector task.

We first demonstrate why the classical optimal control formulation, based on position and velocity state feedback, cannot handle direct feedback on force information. Following previous approaches in force control, we then propose to augment the classical formulations with a model of the robot actuation, which naturally allows to generate online trajectories that adapt to sensed position, velocity and torques. We propose a complete implementation of this idea on the upper part of a real humanoid robot, and show through hardware experiments that this new formulation incorporating effort feedback outperforms classical MPC in challenging tasks where physical interaction with the environment is crucial.}

Furthermore, disturbances arising from unmodelled contact interactions with the environment and model mismatches can hinder the quality of the planned trajectories leading to unsafe motions. In this work, we propose to use stochastic trajectory optimization for generating robust centroidal momentum trajectories to account for additive uncertainties on the model dynamics and parametric uncertainties on contact locations. Through an alternation between the robust centroidal and whole-body trajectory optimizations, we generate robust momentum trajectories while being consistent with the whole-body dynamics. We perform an extensive set of simulations subject to different uncertainties on a quadruped robot showing that our stochastic trajectory optimization problem reduces the amount of foot slippage for different gaits while achieving better performance over deterministic planning.}
