I am actively involved in developing open-source software for robotics research, with a focus on numerical optimization and Model Predictive Control (MPC).

<!-- ## Main Projects
======

### mim_solvers -->
I am one of the main developers and managers of the <a href="https://github.com/machines-in-motion/mim_solvers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mim_solvers</a> library, an efficient numerical optimization solver tailored for nonlinear Model-Predictive Control, compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crocoddyl</a> library.

<!-- **Key Features:**
* High-performance numerical optimization for MPC
* Integration with Crocoddyl for optimal control problem formulation
* Designed for real-time applications on robotic systems -->

<!-- ### croco_mpc_utils -->
I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crocoddyl</a> library by implementing constrained forward dynamics derivatives in moving coordinates, enhancing the library's capabilities for contact tasks. 

I also contributed to the development and democratization of nonlinear MPC in the robotics community through the <a href="https://github.com/machines-in-motion/croco_mpc_utils" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">croco_mpc_utils</a> plugin and introductory examples to Crocoddyl <a href="https://github.com/machines-in-motion/minimal_examples_crocoddyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimal_examples_crocoddyl</a>. These tools enable rapid prototyping of Optimal Control Problems in Crocoddyl through templated configuration files and provides visualization of solutions, effectively lowering the barrier of entry for new users.

<!-- **Key Features:**
* Quick prototyping of Optimal Control Problems
* Template-based configuration files
* Solution visualization tools -->
